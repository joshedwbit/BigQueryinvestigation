# BigQueryinvestigation
[SQL] A demonstration of SQL skills, performing analysis on a large unfamiliar dataset using BigQuery.

In this project I investigated the public BigQuery dataset 'Austin bikeshare', in particular the bikeshare stations and bikeshare trips tables.  Results are shown in the ppt doc.
